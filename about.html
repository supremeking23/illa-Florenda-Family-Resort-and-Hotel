								The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has heavily

								explore the country's top tourist spots. Guide to the

								The hospitality and leisure industry were one of the hardest-hit
								sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. The strict
								community quarantines and shutdowns of hotels, resorts, and
								leisure facilities have dented one of the top economic drivers
								in the country for over seven months under the lockdown. After
								the long wait, the Department of Tourism has finally given the
								go signal for Boracay to receive visitors from areas under
								general community quarantine (GCQ). With the approval of the
								Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging
								Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), DOT Secretary Bernadette
								Romulo-Puyat announced the reopening of the country’s domestic
								tourism starting with Boracay.

									5C’s Analysis
									<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
										<li>
											Company - How successful are your product line? What is
											your image in the marketplace? How effectively are you
											achieving your goals? How does your company’s culture
											affect your performance?
										</li>
										<p>
											Villa Florenda Family Resort is a perfect get-away to
											relieve your mind from the hectic and stressful moments.
											It is the best place to have a relaxation and to spend
											more bonding time with your family and friends.
										</p>
										<p>
											Aside from swimming pool, the resort also offers
											comfortable yet affordable lodging and accommodation and
											an event’s place for any occasions like birthdays,
											weddings, pageants, and the likes.
										</p>

										<p>
											Being “maka-masa” and affordable resort is considered as
											one of their advantages when it comes to selling their
											products and services to their consumers. They simply show
											an image of being a cost-efficient resort. This resort is
											currently a work in progress because they just recently
											added a hotel in their facility to make it more like an
											all-in-one resort since it has lodging and accommodation
											area, leisure and activity area, and event’s area as well.
											The culture of this resort has been and being preserved
											even up to the present. The swimming pool area hasn’t been
											improved or renovated since 1997.
										</p>

										<p>
											However, change is constant and cannot be avoided. By
											this, their customers way back then was not the same with
											the customers that will visit the area. It simply means
											that they should innovate as time evolves. One of the
											customers in the comment section of their Facebook page
											suggested to put some slides to have more fun and exciting
											experience. Also, they should improve their marketing
											strategy for them to know the areas that needs more
											improvement.

										<p>
											- Who is your audience and what is the market size? How
											much is your customer base growing? What motivates
											customers to buy your product or service? What are overall
											sales trends and how is the buying process changing?
										</p>
										<p>
											Anyone can fully enjoy swimming at Villa Florenda Family
											Resort and Hotel. Their market targets children to young
											adults up to seniors who want relaxation and a break from
											the urban life.
										</p>

										<p>
											Their marketing strategy is “lower price but higher
											tourist demand” which in fact because of this kind of
											approach, customers become motivated to keep on coming
											back due to having a low and affordable products and
											services. They focus more on this rather than customers
											who will just visit their place once due to high pricing.
											Therefore, the people who visit the resort keep on
											growing.
										</p>

										<p>
											Unfortunately, due to the risk of Covid-19, the buying
											process of their product and services currently changed
											since they are just accepting booked appointments and not
											walk-ins which will surely affects the sales of their
											company due to the low customer demand.
